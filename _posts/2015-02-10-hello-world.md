Response to Full Service Broker at TD:

You left some key things out from our conversation .  For example, I had wondered why it took TD so long to start being transparent (two years) about fees after CRM2.  You gave excuses about IT changes needed.  But there is no reason that  you couldn't have just called my dad up and made these fees transparent at any time (but especially after it was made law in Jan 2016).  
 
I find that TDs lack of transparency in fees was particularly egregious in the case of elderly people like my parents.  To not even return their calls shows a level of elder abuse that is intolerable. I’ve been reading the CBC investigations into your company’s bad practices and can see much value in increasing awareness of these reprehensible activities .   Note that one of the articles specifically singled out the risk to elderly Canadians.
