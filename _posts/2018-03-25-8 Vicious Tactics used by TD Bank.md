8 Vicious Tactics used by TD Bank to force Bankruptcy on Vertamin Inc


Dear Bharat Masrani,

My name is Ray Kuate. I’m a 52-year-old physically handicap Black-Canadian man from Cameroon. I have a PhD from Ecole Nationale Supérieure du Pétrole et des Moteurs, Université Panthéon Assas, Paris in Econometrics and in my later years picked up two MBA’s in Finance and IT Management from Columbia and Berkeley while raising a boy and a girl. I am a businessman and the CEO of Vertamin. I dream of achieving true excellence in business. My goal is to use my wealth to enrich the community that nurtured me into the individual I am today. Currently, we have the Papa Konga Foundation, a charity which grants scholarships for the most prestigious universities to deserving candidates from poor families. 

As I proceed to the essence of this letter, I have to start by asking; why would anyone destroy $200,000,000 worth of present and future assets because of a $1,000,000 debt? 

1. Discrimination: “People like you.” In a TD boardroom a TD Bank’s manager said to Ray: “I wonder why Columbia University would give an MBA to people like you”.  Ray of course objected vehemently as it is to be expected. It all started with a racist remark and has not stopped since then.

2. Calling the loan with no time to pay contrary to the Supreme Court of Canada’s Jurisprudence: TD Bank decided without warning and contrary to its stated intention, to call in its $1 million line of credit. There was never default on payment by TD Bank’s own admission, yet TD Bank recalled the loan. TD bank knew and wanted Vertamin, bankrupt; they knew while calling that they were killing Vertamin and the jobs of its 27 employees. 

Vertamin’s business model was 100% dependent on the Line of Credit. TD Bank killed Vertamin and claimed my personal guarantee at the same time. Setting your house on fire then claiming insurance before the house is entirely burned is fraud. TD Bank committed fraud by causing insolvency for the sole purpose of claiming its guarantee. 

3. Manipulation of Trustee of Bankruptcy: According to the trustee, he was told by TD bank to declare Vertamin Inc bankrupt, when it was not. This resulted in Scotiabank cancelling its $1,000,000 replacement loan to save the company. Trustee then sent a letter of apology to both Vertamin and ScotiaBank where he admitted it was a mistake.

4. Opposing proposal with no good reason but lies: Because the law requires majority vote for a proposal so that a company can avoid bankruptcy. 

And given the fact that TD lied to Master Roge that they did in fact have the majority of debt and refused to vote for the proposal. The Judge, Master Roge concluded that it wasn’t necessary to extend the deadline for Vertamin to submit a proposal, which resulted in Vertamin’s second bankruptcy. 

5. Leading Judges to Making Up Facts: The judge stated that Vertamin Inc was in default in payment, which wasn’t true. The records show that Vertamin was never once default of payment yet the Judge tried to justify TD’s actions by manufacturing false information about Vertamin being late on payments.

6. Refusing to act in good faith: I have a real estate company with $12,000,000 worth of assets that could have been used as collateral, but TD didn’t want it. TD Bank’s action is jeopardizing future earnings of this company, about $200,000,000 in real estate development. These developments would have enriched the City of Ottawa by creating housing and economic development. For $1,000,000, TD Bank caused the insolvency of a company worth $12,000,000.

Why wouldn’t TD Bank accept a settlement that includes giving me time to sell real estate or allowing me to put real estate in collateral for its debt? 

TD Bank is not interested in payment, rather in destroying minority owned businesses. 

7. Delaying the court process: TD bank has an army of lawyers that plan to drag out the case as long as possible. All this in hope that I won’t be able to keep up with the legal bills and costs associated with fighting them,

8. Refusing all reasonable settlement offers: have made 10 different offers to pay and settle, but TD Bank declined all. 

TD’s Accusations 

TD Bank initially accused us of conversion of funds then backed away, just to realize it was pure defamation and discrimination

TD then changed their accusation to diversion of receivables, then backed away again. Vertamin had no obligation to bank with TD Bank exclusively.

TD then argued that funds were used for purposes other than the original purpose and we have proof and evidence that TD was always made aware and even gave authorization to use funds by issuing all drafts necessary for each property acquisition. 

Because of this terrible situation, 27 people lost their jobs, plans for development of a master building (www.ottawahighpoint.ca) and improvement of the city were stopped and a growing and prospering Canadian company was put to death.


Canada stands for freedom, equality, and diversity. TD Bank has just demonstrated to the entire country that it stands apart from these values, and can and will do what it wants.

Mr. Masrani, we are hoping that this is all news to you. As it is possible that things happening in the lower levels of the organization don’t come to your attention. We urge you to step in and help both parties settle this dispute. TD Bank’s behavior has caused tremendous suffering to myself and my employees as well as damaged the reputation of your corporation in the eyes of the public. 

There is nothing I want more that to resurrect Vertamin and the projects I had worked a lifetime to build. Remember Mr. Masrani, there is an old saying: “A bad settlement is better than a good trial.” I would state instead that a bad settlement is way better than a social media trial.” 

Finally, Mr. Masrani, damage control is not always the right solution.

Regards,
Ray Kuate.
